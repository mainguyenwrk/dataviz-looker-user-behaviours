1. Usage Patterns:
    * Annual Members:
        * Stable ridership throughout the week, indicating likely use for commuting.
    * Casual Riders:
        * Usage peaks on weekends, especially Saturdays, suggesting leisure or sports activities.
        * Ridership drops in late months (October onwards) due to colder weather and snow, with a peak during summer (June - July).
2. Ride Duration and Frequency:
    * Casual riders have significantly longer average trip durations than annual members, nearly double, reinforcing the leisure use hypothesis.
    * Annual members likely use bikes for short commutes, as indicated by usage peaks at typical commuting hours (7-8 am, 12 pm, 5 pm).
    * Casual riders’ total time on bikes is nearly double that of annual members, despite fewer trips overall.

    * Offer off-peak annual membership discounts: Encourage riders to ride outside peak office hours and convert casual riders to members.
    * Provide weekend or short-term passes: Entice frequent casual riders to consider membership.
    * Introduce quarterly or monthly subscriptions: Minimize the initial cost and commitment barrier, making membership more accessible.
